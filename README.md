# TabSplit
Chrome Extension - Create multiple pseudo tabs inside an active chrome tab
## This is still a PoC!
The tabs are generated by using the iframe element, thus there are some limitations.
The extension is not yet finished and I started it just for fun.

The UI is done with **JS**, **jQuery 3.4.0**, **HTML**/**CSS** and **Bootstrap 5**.
## The extension is limited by the same-origin policy!
At the actual stage, this is a **BIG** issue
### The extension is not yet complete and some of the code is still being written...
